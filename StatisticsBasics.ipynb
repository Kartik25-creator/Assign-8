        "##### #Ans.Data can be categorized into two primary types: qualitative (categorical) and quantitative (numerical).Here's a detailed explanation of both types, along with examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Qualitative Data (Categorical Data)\n",
        "Qualitative data refers to non-numeric information that represents categories or qualities. It helps describe attributes or characteristics. Qualitative data can be further divided into two main subtypes:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Nominal Data\\\n",
        "Definition:Nominal data refers to categories that do not have any inherent order or ranking.The categories are mutually exclusive and are used for labeling variables.\\\n",
        "Example:\\\n",
        "Gender (Male, Female, Non-binary)\\\n",
        "Eye color (Blue, Green, Brown)\\\n",
        "Marital status (Single, Married, Divorced)\\\n",
        "In nominal data, there's no meaningful way to rank or order the categories.\\\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Ordinal Data\\\n",
        "Definition:Ordinal data also represents categories but with a meaningful order or ranking. The differences between the ranks may not be uniform or measurable.\\\n",
        "Example:\\\n",
        "Education level (High school, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, Doctorate)\\\n",
        "Satisfaction rating (Very unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, Very satisfied)\\\n",
        "Ordinal data indicates an order but doesn't tell you how much greater one category is compared to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Quantitative Data (Numerical Data)\\\n",
        "Quantitative data refers to data that can be measured and expressed numerically.It allows for mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction,multiplication and division.Quantitative data can also be subdivided into two types:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Interval Data\\\n",
        "Definition:Interval data represents numeric values where the difference between values is meaningful.However,interval data does not have a true zero point.\\\n",
        "Example:\\\n",
        "Temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit):The difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as between 30°C and 40°C, but 0°C does not indicate the absence of temperature.\\\n",
        "IQ scores:The difference between scores is meaningful but a score of 0 doesn't mean a complete absence of intelligence.\\\n",
        "Interval data allows for the calculation of differences but ratios (e.g., twice as much) are not meaningful because there's no true zero.\\\n",
        "b. Ratio Data\\\n",
        "Definition:Ratio data is similar to interval data but has a true zero point,meaning zero indicates the absence of the quantity being measured. Both differences and ratios are meaningful.\\\n",
        "Example:\\\n",
        "Height (in cm or inches):A person who is 0 cm tall has no height.\\\n",
        "Weight (in kilograms or pounds):A weight of 0 kg means no weight.\\\n",
        "Income:A person with an income of 0 dollars has no income, and we can say that someone earning 40000 dollars has twice the income of someone earning 20000 dollars.\\\n",
        "Ratio data supports a wide range of statistical operations, including meaningful ratios.\n"

        "When to Use:Best for symmetrical data without outliers.\\\n",
        "Situations: Average scores, income, or temperatures.\n",
        "2. Median\\\n",
        "Definition:The middle value when data is ordered. If there's an even number, it's the average of the two middle values.\\\n",
        "Example: For 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, the median is 80.\n",

        "##### #Ans.Random sampling is a method where every individual in a population has an equal chance of being selected.This technique is essential for making reliable inferences about the population because it ensures the sample is representative of the broader group,minimizing bias and allowing for generalization.When a sample is randomly selected,the data collected can be used to estimate population parameters(such as means or proportions) and to test hypotheses.By relying on random sampling, researchers can use statistical methods to draw conclusions about the population with greater confidence as it ensures that the sample mirrors the diversity and characteristics of the population.This approach is fundamental for producing valid, unbiased, and generalizable results."

        "\n",
        "There are three types of skewness:\n",
        "\n",
        "Positive Skew (Right Skew):The right tail (higher values) is longer than the left.The mean is greater than the median,indicating that most data points are concentrated on the lower end of the scale.\n",

        "Negative Skew (Left Skew):The left tail (lower values) is longer than the right.The mean is less than the median, suggesting that most data points are concentrated on the higher end of the scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "No Skew (Symmetrical):The distribution is balanced with the mean and median being approximately equal and there is no skewness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Effect on Data Interpretation:Skewness can impact the choice of central tendency measure.In a positively skewed distribution the mean may be misleading as it is pulled by extreme values,so the median might provide a better representation of central tendency.Similarly,in negatively skewed data,the median might be a more accurate measure.Understanding skewness helps in making more informed decisions about which statistical tools to use and how to interpret the data.\n",
